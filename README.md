#BASIC CALCULATOR

A basic calculator guided by a [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j59qQ7YWLxw&ab_channel=WebDevSimplified) tutorial for learning purposes. HTML/CSS was done from scratch and utilized [Bootstrap Grid](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/main/dist/css/bootstrap-grid.css) for layout. Majority of JavaScript is from [Vanilla JavaScript Tutorial](https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/Vanilla-JavaScript-Calculator) repository. I added my own feature of utilizing the calculator using keystrokes for easier input.
